      <description>This semester when we first began using Python, I was a little off put and didn’t immedietly see the benefits of the new tool. It may just be the simplicity of the homework and the code, but I was amazed when we started using Python for nucleotide sequencing. It was amazing that in basically one line of code, I could filter through the long line of nucleotides and find “3-mers” that would show the protein sequence.</description>

      <description>R Markdown The two datasets chosen for this project were Bad_drivers and partisan_lean_state. The bad drivers dataset shows gives amounts of collisions under circumstances such as speeding, alcohol, etc as well as data on insurance premiums cost and lost based on states. The partisan dataset shows the party of the vote, how they lean, and the Cook Voting Index. I selected the two datasets from the fivethirtyeight to see if there were any potential associations between state, party, and “bad driving”.</description>
