      <description>This semester when we first began using Python, I was a little off put and didn’t immedietly see the benefits of the new tool. It may just be the simplicity of the homework and the code, but I was amazed when we started using Python for nucleotide sequencing. It was amazing that in basically one line of code, I could filter through the long line of nucleotides and find “3-mers” that would show the protein sequence.</description>
